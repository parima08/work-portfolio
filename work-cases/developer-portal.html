                    <p>The Automata Processor is amazing piece of technology - it enables engineers to create massively parallel, reconfigurable processing architectures. The AP was built to purposely address the processing challenges associated with real time data analysis, high performance pattern matching, and data analytics. </p>

                    <p>With the new and upcoming release of their revolutionary product, Micron wanted to introduce the world to the Automata Processor with an equally revolutionary website. They wanted the brand of their new product to reflect the innovation of their technology, but at the same time tie it back to their parent Micron brand. They, also, wanted users to be able to collaborate and share their findings on the very many uses the processor had in real-world applications.

                  <h3> The Solution</h3>
                    <p>Because of that, we decided to introduce the processor through a developer portal separate (but linked) to the original Micron site. By doing this, we would be able to showcase the various vertical industry segments that the AP processor targeted and allow for greater support for further development (and use) of the processor. </p>

                    <p>Furthermore, in addition to developing an organized, well designed site, we needed to develop a licensing system and admin portal.  They wanted to control multiple levels of user-access in both their software and on their site. In order to ease the approval system, I build an admin portal that hooked with their licensing model (leveraging the Flexeria and Nalperion Licensing API).  Futhermore, the  Administrator Dashboard provided a staging publishing flow for new documentation and software releases</p>

                    <p>Another challenge in this project was that Micron need to be able to easily sync their constantly evolving documentation to the website. This proved to be a challenge as their documentation was written in various formats and was constantly changing. In order to solve this problem, I created a parser that would taken their given documents, parse and process the information, convert it to HTML, and push the changes into the site. Micron no longer need to change their format and mechanism of doing documentation and were able to easily push updates on their website. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Lastly, Micron wanted to create a web simulator of the tools present in their SDK. We built a simulator for them and integrated it onto the site. </p>

                    <p>Although it was not required by the client, we made an internal decision to make this website compatible for mobile devices, or "responsive". In today's world, about 50% of website visits are off mobile and tablet devices. With this in mind, we wanted to make sure that this website would appeal to this set of users. We employed the technique of responsive design, polyfills, and shivs in our process. </p>
                    <p>
                    We used Selenium for testing purposes. The site was deployed on Micronâ€™s internal linux system (within their DMZs). As their DMZ did not have any external connections or proxies, I had to hand install all dependencies.</p>

                    <p>As the lead on this project, I acted as a mentor to many junior developers, conducting code reviews in Gerrit, etc. </p>
