                    One of America’s forefront banks wanted to incentivize their clients to open accounts for their children while being able to educate the new generation on basic budgeting concepts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The approach that was conceptualized by our team was an Internet of Things Piggybank that would allow:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Children to interact and engage with a physical artifact to help educate them on budgeting. </li>
                    <li>Parents to easily deposit money in the children’s bank account. </li>
                  </ol>
                  
                  <h3> Solution Architecture: </h3>
                  <p>
                    I was involved with architecting interaction between the mobile application and the actual physical Piggybank through a cloud API.  As the solution had to be extensible and flexible to fit in the client’s current application,  I developed an abstraction layer library with a well documented API. This architecture allowed for easy integration with any (existing) app. In order to demonstrate the ease-of-use, I also crafted a minimal demo application that interacted with the physical artifact. You can check out a video on the interaction below.
                  </p> 
                  <p>
                    On of the biggest challenges on this project was developing our module for provisioning. We had to architect a solution over the bluetooth stack so that the app would be able toto bring the hardware device online. I wrote an Android library that would allow the mobile device connect to the Piggybank over Bluetooth, pass wifi credentials to the hardware, and disconnect once the Piggybank would be successfully connected.
