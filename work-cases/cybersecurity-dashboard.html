                    Following up on the DDoS prevention protocol we had written earlier, our client requested a visualization tool that would allow a non-technical audience to understand how the protocol worked. We decided to build a web-based visualization tool that would be able extend itâ€™s functionality from being just an educational tool, to a functional tool that would be able to hook into cyber ranges and actually expose real time attacks in real time.

                  <p>
                    A UI Specialist and I came together and looked at various metaphors for defense and attack systems.

                  <h3> The Solution</h3>
                  <p>
                   After examining several options, we narrowed down on using the metaphor of biological inflammation as a way of showing attack and defense, we mapped network attacks and responses using a force-directed graph with the target system at the center.  Attacks are shown as red inflammation, clustered around the target system. When the defense is activated, it pushes the inflammation back to its sources, restoring healthy networks and communications. The system had a demo-able mode and easily allowed non-technical users to get familiarized with the back end protocol.  
                  </p> 
                  <p>
                    I built the tool a top HTML Canvas, leveraging the D3 library to help build the force-directed graph. The end product resulted in being an interactive, graphic version of a network topology on fly, configurable to the client's needs. The tool allowed the users to step through example of a DDoS attack and actually watch what happens when a network is under attack.  Once the cybersecurity protocol would kick in, the user would be able to witness the robustness and resilience of our protocol to these various types of attacks.
