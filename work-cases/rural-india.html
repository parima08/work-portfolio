               <p>  India’s educational landscape is very interesting. The country overall is very educated - it’s a huge supplier for outsourced jobs and a home to 125 million English speakers.
               </p>
                <p> However, at the same time, it is largely unequal, allowing many without access to an education, to fall through it’s cracks. Unsurprisingly, one of the reasons this might be so is because the country has lots of isolated rural areas. It’s easier to gain access to a good education in urban areas where one can set up a smaller number of better schools to server a larger population. However, in the rural areas, there are fewer schools and a lack of an infrastructure to gain a good education. </p>

                <p>While I was India, I partnered up with an organization (Love and Care) to design a curriculum that would inspire rural students in Gujarat with little exposure to technology and science to, perhaps, pursue a career in that field. </p>

                <p>The first school we looked at only had 12 computers, 9 of which had no internet access. I knew that whatever I designed had to be done using limited resources. </p>

                <p>So now, how do I teach computer science without computers? </p>

                <p>A lot of computer science lies in logic; while the syntax matters, as an introduction, I wanted to show them what it means to think like an engineer- the blend of creativity and specificity that goes into programming. </p>

                <h3> Thus, I devised a 3 hour program, split up into 3 sections: </h3>
<h3>Think outside the box: </h3>
                    <p>
                        We had the kids build a tower that had to be 1 meter high using supplies provided to them - paper, straws, rubber bands, tape, staples.  Each item had a cost and they had a budget of how many points they could use to build their tower.  They were forced to architect, budget, and build their solution - including all aspects of any engineering project. </p>
<h3>How to think specifically: </h3>
                        <p>
                        Once we taught them to think creatively, we also had to stress the importance of thinking specifically. Computers are machines that need explicit instructions to function. We wanted them to experiment with communication and observe the challenges in giving instructions. We divided the group into two - one would present the machine and the other would present the engineer. We gave all the engineers a simple line-drawn picture. The machine would not be allowed to look at the picture, but would have to recreate the picture (sun, sailboat, etc) based on the instructions of the engineer. The students were forced to appreciate the clarity of language. </p>
<h3>Algorithms:   </h3>
                        <p>
                        We wanted to demonstrate the need for algorithms and the efficiency of various algorithms. The best way for them to learn was to experience the algorithm. We settled on using sorting algorithms as it would be easiest to demonstrate. </p>
                        <p>
                        All children were given a piece of paper with a number on it. They had to stand in random order. Three students were then tasked to put the rest of the students in order. At first, they struggled a bit.</p>
                        <p>
                        We introduced the concept on Bubble Sort and let them try it out on their classmates. Then we introduced the concept of Merge Sort and the efficiencies involved. </p>


                 <div class = 'section'> 
                  <h3>Result</h3>
                 
                 <p> Overall, it was a huge learning experience for me. Many students were interested in pursuing computer science after learning about the various applications and scope for the future. It was really rewarding to hear their questions and to guide them on various career paths in STEM. </p>

                <p>The course was added to the organization curriculum and was planned to be implemented in their partner schools due to the success of the workshop here. </p>
