                 <p> L7 is a local creative branding agency that needed support in developing responsive web presences for their clients. I worked with them on hiring resources from Eastern Europe at a lower price point, setting up a Drupal team in Ukraine for them, and driving these projects to completion.  Through our partnership, we worked on a total of 3 projects: Honor Life, Partner ESI, and DoD Stem http://www.dodstem.us/  </p>

                <p>The project provided me with a particular challenges that I learned greatly from: </p>

                <p><b>Hiring:</b> I had to hire talent abroad, over Skype. At first, I’ll admit, I made hiring mistakes. However, quickly I realized that technical interviews were not the best way to gauge the quality of code produced by an developer. Instead, at the end, I had them submit a sample of their previous code and we would walk through it together. </p>

                <p><b>Cultural Differences:</b> There were cultural work differences when working with a team abroad. I quickly learned that a large part of my job was acting like a translator between the client’s needs and the developer’s constraints. </p>

                <p><b>Fixed Cost Points:</b> A lot of these contracts were Fixed Cost rather than Time and Materials. Because of that, a lot estimation effort had to go in properly quoting the client a reasonable and fair price point. This process was an excellent learning tool to refine my skills and methods of development estimation - a tool that has proved to be very helpful moving forward.</p> 

                <p style = "padding-bottom: 100px">At the end, we presented our client with three beautiful websites that they were very happy with and I learned a lot about project management through this process (and through my initial mistakes).</p>
